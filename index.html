        <p>I teach primary, secondary and A-level maths. From experience I have found that confidence is a key issue for many students; I work patiently with them to build this over time.</p>

        <p>I tailor my lessons specifically for each student. For primary-school and year 7 students I make maths more fun, creative, and engaging. I will often use real-life examples like dividing sweets for ratios. For year 8-11 students the maths is more focused on the school syllabus, particularly the new curriculum as several A-level topics have been moved down to GCSE. For A-level students I focus on exam-style techniques and targeted revision.</p>

        <p>In addition to traditional face-to-face tutoring, I also provide tailored homework to every student after each session. I have found this helps significantly with retention.</p>
