                <p>Private maths tutor with 1st-class BSc Mathematics degree and teacher training from the University of Oxford.Â Offering Primary, Secondary and A-Level maths tutoring in the Greater Manchester area.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Primary</span> - Maths lessons are fun and creative. Often use of real-life examples such as dividing sweets for ratios to make maths more relatable and engaging.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Secondary</span> - KS3 and GCSE lessons are more focused on the school syllabus, particularly the new curriculum as several A-Level topics have recently been moved down to GCSE.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">A-Level</span> - Exam-style techniques and targeted revision are essential. Students now take all maths exams at the end of Year 13 so extra effort is needed to stay on top of all topics.</p>

                <p>Tailored homework is provided to students after each lesson. 100% success rate of students achieving target grade, with many going beyond this.
