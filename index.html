                <p>Dedicated maths tutor with 1st-class BSc Mathematics degree and teacher training from the University of Oxford. 100% success rate of students achieving their target grade, with many of them going beyond this.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Primary</span> - Maths lessons are fun and creative. Often use of real-life examples such as dividing sweets for ratios to make maths more relatable and engaging.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Secondary</span>- KS3 and GCSE lessons are more focused on the school syllabus, particularly the new curriculum as several A-level topics have recently been moved down to GCSE.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">A-level</span> - Exam-style techniques and targeted revision are essential. Students now take all maths exams at the end of Year 13 so extra effort is needed to stay on top of all topics.</p>

                <p>Tailored homework is provided to students after each lesson. Tuition is offered in your home (within 10 miles of the centre of Manchester) or my own.</p>
